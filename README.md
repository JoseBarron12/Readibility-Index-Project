# Readability Index Program

## Overview

Welcome to the Readability Index Program! This C++ program is designed to calculate the readability index of given sentences. The program utilizes a custom `strextra.h` library that provides functions for string manipulation and searching. It employs a unique approach to counting syllables, taking into account adjacent vowels and other factors.

## Features

- **Sentence Input:**
  - Allows users to input multiple sentences for analysis.

- **Word and Syllable Count:**
  - Counts the number of sentences, words, and syllables in the input.

- **Syllable Calculation:**
  - Utilizes a custom approach to calculate syllables, considering adjacent vowels and other factors in each word.

- **Readability Index:**
  - Calculates the readability index based on the number of syllables, words, and sentences.

## Test Runs

The program has been extensively tested with various sentences to ensure accurate syllable counting and readability index calculation.

1. **Basic Input**
   - User inputs a simple sentence.
   - Program correctly counts the number of sentences, words, syllables, and calculates the readability index.

2. **Multiple Sentences**
   - User inputs multiple sentences.
   - The program accurately calculates cumulative counts for sentences, words, syllables, and determines the overall readability index.

3. **Complex Sentence Structure**
   - User inputs sentences with varied structures.
   - The program handles different sentence structures, ensuring accurate syllable counting and readability index calculation.
